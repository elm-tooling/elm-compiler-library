# Elm Compiler library (archived)

This is a library version of the [Elm Compiler](https://github.com/elm/compiler), used by third party tools such as the [Elm Language Server-Haskell](http://github.com/elm-tooling/elm-language-server-haskell).

For documentation on how it works, see the file `COMPILER.md`.
